# The-Importance-Of-CPD

CPD stands for Continuous Professional Development, and refers to the process where profesionals in the workplace can continue to learn and expand upon their skills and knowledge within their specific field. An good example of this cn be found in the cyber-security industry. Hackers are always finding new ways of causing problems for other computer users or companies with big IT systems, so someone who completed their qualifications and began working in the early 2000's would have to keep learning about new threats that are discovered and how to deal with them. If he was unable to do this he would quickly fall behind and would no longer be able to protect the computer systems he is responsible for.

CPD is important because it is essential for someone to continue to perform well at their job. As the field develops so must the professionals. Companies will always look to hire the most knowlegeable person(s) for the job, so in order to keep your job you must be able to develop, learn and adapt to anything new that comes up in your field, otherwise the company would look to replace you as having someone who can practice CPD is near essential for any company to thrive in the long term.
